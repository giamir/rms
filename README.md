## Rental Management System (RMS)

A relational database project to manage property rents using relational algebra and plain SQL.

Unfortunately all the documentation is only in Italian for now (I'm counting to translate that as soon as I can).<br>
You can have a look at the project specific and how I proceeded to implement it reading _[this PDF](https://github.com/giamir/rms/RMS.pdf)_
